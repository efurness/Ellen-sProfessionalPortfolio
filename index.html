                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>I come from a conservation background as my father pursued conservation of endangered species while
                    working for the US State Department.
                    Along with his posts in Ireland, Vietnam, and Okinawa, he worked alongside the US Fish and Wildlife
                    Service
                    and started the non-profit Conservation
                    Treaty Support Fund to support <a href="https://cites.org">CITES</a>, the Convention of the
                    International Trade in Endangered
                    Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. <a href="https://worldwildlife.org">World Wildlife Fund</a>, and <a
                        href="https://traffic.org">TRAFFIC</a> also contribute to the Convention protecting species like
                    elephants, rhinos and snow leopards, all vulnerable species because of poaching and illegal trade.

                <h3>My Bio</h3>
                <p> I was born in DC and came out to Colorado and fell in love with Crested Butte and so I stayed.
                    I love hiking with my dog as you can see in the photos below. I love all dogs but have
                    an affinity for my english creams. I love cycling, snowshoeing, and skiing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Education </h3>
                <p>With this background, I started out studying Biology at Colorado College.
                    I then pursued Population Biology for my Masters. I studied the Psittacine Species of the South
                    American continent and my Masters was to develop a plan for their conservation.
                    I have a second Masters in Geographical Information Systems at the University of Denver.
                    I was graciously able to work in a partnership between DU and the National Park Service.
                    My continuing education consists of taking GIS courses at CU, here is one of my  <embed src="https://github.com/efurness/Unit2-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio.git/GIS.pdf" type="application/pdf" />
                    I now enjoy taking the DU coding bootcamp for web development.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Professional work and goals</h3>
                </p> This led me to work at US agencies like the US Forest Service and National Park Service.
                I assisted in Burned Area Emergency Rehabiliation for the US Forest Service.
                I also conducted GIS mapping using ArcInfo and ortho-imagery, DOQ's and continued doing this mapping work
                delineating the rehab areas. For the National Park Service I worked for the <a href="https://nps.gov/orgs/1971/index.htm">Air Resources Division</a>, please see website for sample work. 
                I helped the Lead Biologist in conducting internet research on pollution affecting biological species.
                I also developed Air Resources maps and updated and maintained NPS AIR websites.
                During this time, I maintained the Colorado College Geography and ISIS Antarctica websites.
                Now, I am interested in advanced web development still focused toward Biology, Mapping and Conservation.
