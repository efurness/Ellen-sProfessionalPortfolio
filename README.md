# Unit2-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

### Description 

This project had me develop a Portfolio webpage from scratch. It has a simple design with a banner and links that target topics down the page about my background, a bio, education and profession.  On the bottom of page are images in column format in which you can hover over and it zooms over image.  Included in the unit are css style sheet, images, and an index page along with pdfs  There are live links on the page. In the future I will put current projects from the DU bootcamp for web development.
